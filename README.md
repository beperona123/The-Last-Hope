# The-Last-Hope
The Last Hope is a 2D platform game developed  for PC using the Unity Engine. It was developed as a final project for my course in college with a team of four developers.  In the game, Cassius, a scientist, explores planet Domum to find his ancestors. He encounters puzzles, traps, and disasters to uncover the planet's secret.
